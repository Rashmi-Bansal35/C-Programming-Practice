# C Programming Practice

Welcome! This repository contains my solutions to 100+ C programming questions, organized by topic and progressing from beginner to more than intermediate level.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `Variables, Data Type & Input-Output/` – Questions about variables, data types, and input/output in C.
- `Instructions, Expressions & Operators/` – Questions related to instructions, expressions, and operators.
- `Decision control structure/` – Questions on decision-making structures (if, else, switch, etc.).

## 🚀 Goal
Solve at least 100 C programming problems covering a wide range of topics from basics to intermediate.
