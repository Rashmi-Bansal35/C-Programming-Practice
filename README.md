## 📚 Challenge Source

These 100+ C programming practice questions are inspired by the [KG Coding Classes YouTube Channel](https://youtu.be/p0QUmC2WJwM?si=WWivfgtK_2qNu_mH), where this challenge was originally shared.  
I took on this challenge and solved each problem independently to strengthen my understanding of C programming.

If you’re interested in learning C or want to try the challenge yourself, check out the original video and try solving the problems on your own before reviewing my solutions!
