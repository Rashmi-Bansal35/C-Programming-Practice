# C Programming Practice

Welcome! This repository contains my solutions to 100+ C programming questions, organized by topic and progressing from beginner to more than intermediate level.  Whether you're a student, preparing for interviews, or just looking to improve your C skills, you'll find a wide variety of problems here.

## 📚 Challenge Source

These 100+ C programming practice questions are inspired by the [KG Coding Classes YouTube Channel](https://youtu.be/p0QUmC2WJwM?si=WWivfgtK_2qNu_mH), where this challenge was originally shared.  
I took on this challenge and solved each problem independently to strengthen my understanding of C programming.

If you’re interested in learning C or want to try the challenge yourself, check out the original video and try solving the problems on your own before reviewing my solutions!
